    subsection#subsec-triangles
        title A question about triangles

        p
            | Does there exist a rational right triangle and  a rational isosceles triangle with with same perimeter and same area?
            | (rational means all side lengths are rational)

        p
            | Suppose there does exist such a pair, then introducing parameters, #[m k,t] for the right triangle, and #[m l,u] for the isosceles we can rescale to
            me k,t,u \in \QQ
            me 0 \lt t, u \lt 1,\, k \gt 0
            | an equate areas and perimeters.
            | Areas:
            me \frac 12(2kt)(k)(1-t^2) = \frac 12(4u)(1-u^2)
            me \implies k^2 t^2(1-t^2) = 2u (1-u^2)
            | . Perimeters:
            me k(1-t^2) + k(1+t^2) + 2kt = 1 + u^2 + 1 + u^2 + 4u
            me \implies k+ kt = 1 + 2u + u^2 = (1+u)^2
            | so letting #[m x=1 +u], after some algebra we have #[m 1 \lt x \lt 2] in #[m \QQ] s.t.
            me 2xk^2 + (-3x^3 -2x^2 + 6x - 4)k + x^5 = 0
            | this is a quadratic in #[m k], and the discriminant is a square in #[m \QQ].
            |so
            me X\colon  y^2 = (-3x^3 - 2*x^2 + 6x - 4)^2 - 4(2x)x^5
            me = x^{6} + 12 x^{5} - 32 x^{4} + 52 x^{2} - 48 x + 16
            | so this is a genus 2 hyperelliptic curve. We need the #[m \QQ]-points of this.
        paragraphs
            title Facts:
            p
                | #[m \Jac(X)]  has Mordell-Weil rank 1.
                | The Chabauty-Coleman bound on the size of #[m X(\QQ)] for this curve gives #[m \#X(\QQ) \le 10].
                | But we find points
                md
                    mrow \left\{ \left(0 : -4 : 1\right), \infty_{\pm} , \left(0 : 4 : 1\right), \left(1 : -1 : 1\right), \left(1 : 1 : 1\right),\left(\frac{12}{11} : -\frac{868}{1331} : 1\right),\right.
                    mrow \left. \left(\frac{12}{11} : \frac{868}{1331} : 1\right), \left(2 : -8 : 1\right), \left(2 : 8 : 1\right)\right\}
                | so this set is #[m X(\QQ)].
        p
            | Back in the original problem we specified #[m x \lt 1 \lt 2], so there is a unique such pair of triangles:
        theorem
            title Hirakawa-Matsumura '18
            statement: p
                | Up to similitude there exists a unique pair of a rational right triangle and a rational isosceles triangle that have the same perimeters and areas.
                | The unique pair consists of a right triangle with sides
                me (377, 135, 352)
                | and the isosceles triangle with sides
                me (366, 366, 132)
                | .
    subsection
        title Why care about #[m X(\QQ)] for #[m X] of genus 2?

        p
            | Curves of genus 0: have no #[m \QQ]-points or infinitely many, they satisfy a local to global principle so there exists an algorithm to determine the #[m \QQ]-points in finite time.

        p
            | Curves of genus 1: If we have 1 smooth rational point then we have an elliptic curve, Mordell's theorem implies that #[m E(\QQ)] is a finitely generated abelian group,
            me E(\QQ) \simeq \ZZ^r \oplus T
            | where the possible torsion parts #[m T] have been determined by Mazur's theorem.
            | To understand #[m T], and the distribution of #[m T] there is work of Harron and Snowden, this often comes down to understanding rational points on #[m X_1(N)].
        p
            | Upshot: to understand #[m E(\QQ)] we want to understand #[m r]:
        p
            | Q1: is there an algorithm to compute #[m  r]?
        p
            | Q2: what values of                   #[m  r] can occur?
        p
            | Q3: what is the distribution of      #[m  r]?
        p
            | A1: #[m n]-descent, the obstacle is #[m \Sha], proving finiteness, it is conjectured that #[m r =  \ord_{s=1}L(E,s)] (BSD).
        p
            | A2: record due to Noam Elkies an example of #[m E] with #[m r \ge 28].
        p
            | A3: minimalist conjecture: 50% of all curves have rank 0, 50% rank 1.

            | Goal today: prove Coleman's refinement of Chabauty's theorem.

        theorem
            title Coleman 1985
            statement: p
                | Let #[m X/\QQ] be a curve of genus #[m g \ge 2].
                | Suppose the Mordell-Weil rank of #[m J(\QQ)] is less than #[m g].
                | Then if #[m p \gt 2g] is a good prime for #[m X] we have

            statement
                p
                    | Let #[m X] be a  curve over a field #[m k].
                    | The space of #[term differentials] on #[m X] over #[m k] is a 1-dimensional #[m k(X)]-vector space #[m \Omega ^1_X(k)].

                    | for all #[m f,g\in k(X)] and there is some #[m f \in k(X)] s.t. #[m \diff f \ne 0].
                p
                    | A general differential can be written as #[m \omega  = f \diff g] where #[m g\in K(X)] with #[m \diff g \ne 0].
                    | If we fix #[m g] this representation is unique.
                    | If #[m \omega ,\omega ' \in \Omega ^1_X(k)] with #[m \omega ' \ne0] then there's a unique #[m f\in K(X)] s.t. #[m \omega = f\omega '].

            statement

            statement
                p
